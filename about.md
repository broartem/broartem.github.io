Hi! My name is Artem Plotnikov. I am a software engeneer and my career focus is on delivering scalable distributed data processing and data visualization applications. I have an experience in developing applications with Apache Kafka, Apache Storm and Apache Spark using machine learning techniques to provide valuable B2B services. Also, I have developed several scientific visualization applications running on the top of HPC clusters.

My alma mater is [Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology](https://mipt.ru/en/) and currently I am a PhD student at [Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics](http://keldysh.ru/index.en.shtml). See my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/artemplotnikov) profile for more details.

Here I write about various technical topics.
